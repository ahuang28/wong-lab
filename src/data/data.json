        "content": "Stress is the main risk factor of depression. However, many individuals are resilient to stress that protect them from developing depression. We are interested in understanding the biological mechanism of stress resilience. Using various in vitro (e.g., electrophysiology) and in vivo techniques (e.g., calcium imaging), we examine changes in brain functions at the levels of synapses, neurons, and network that are related to stress resilience."
