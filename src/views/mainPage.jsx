                        <AccordionContent>
                            Understanding the individual variability that comes with the likelihood of developing stress-related psychopathologies is of paramount importance when addressing mechanisms of their neurobiology. This article focuses on the hippocampus as a region that is highly influenced by chronic stress exposure and that has strong ties to the development of related disorders, such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. We first outline three commonly used animal models that have been used to separate animals into susceptible and resilient cohorts. Next, we review molecular and functional hippocampal markers of susceptibility and resilience. We propose that the hippocampus plays a crucial role in the differences in the processing and storage of stress-related information in animals with different stress susceptibilities. These hippocampal markers not only help us attain a more comprehensive understanding of the various facets of stress-related pathophysiology, but also could be targeted for the development of new treatments.

                        <AccordionTrigger>Negative Memory Engrams in the Hippocampus Enhance the Susceptibility to Chronic Social Defeat Stress</AccordionTrigger>
                        <AccordionContent>
                            The hippocampus has been highly implicated in depression symptoms. Recent findings suggest that the expression and susceptibility of depression symptoms are related to the enhanced functioning of the hippocampus. We reasoned that hippocampal engrams, which represent ensembles of neurons with increased activity after memory formation, could underlie some contributions of the hippocampus to depression symptoms. Using the chronic social defeat stress model, we examined social defeat-related hippocampal engrams in mice that are either susceptible or resilient to the stressor. TetTag mice were used to label social defeat-related hippocampal ensembles by LacZ. Engram cells correspond to ensembles that were reactivated by the same stressor. Compared with resilient and nonstressed control mice, susceptible mice exhibited a higher reactivation of social defeat-related LacZ-labeled cells (i.e., engram cells) in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampal CA1 regions. The density of CA1 engram cells correlated with the level of social avoidance. Using DREADD and optogenetic approaches to activate and inactivate social defeat-related CA1 engram cells enhanced and suppressed social avoidance, respectively. Increased engram cells in susceptible mice could not be found in the dentate gyrus. Susceptible mice exhibited more negative stimuli-related, but not neutral stimuli-related, CA1 engram cells than resilient mice in the dorsal hippocampus. Finally, chronic, but not a short and subthreshold, social defeat protocol was necessary to increase CA1 engram cell density. The susceptibility to chronic social defeat stress is regulated by hippocampal CA1 engrams for negative memory. Hippocampal negative memory engrams may underlie the vulnerability and expression of cognitive symptoms in depression.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We provided evidence that negative memory hippocampal engrams contribute to the susceptibility to developing depression-related behavior after chronic social defeat stress. The activation of positive memory engrams has been shown to alleviate depression-related behaviors, while our findings reveal the pathological roles of negative memory engrams that could lead to those behaviors. Increased negative memory engrams could be a downstream effect of the reported high hippocampal activity in animal models and patients with depression. Unlike affective symptoms, we know much less about the cellular mechanisms of the cognitive symptoms of depression. Given the crucial roles of hippocampal engrams in memory formation, enhanced reactivation of negative memory engrams could be an important cellular mechanism that underlies the cognitive symptoms of depression.

                        <AccordionTrigger>The susceptibility to chronic social defeat stress is related to low hippocampal extrasynaptic NMDA receptor function</AccordionTrigger>
                        <AccordionContent>
                        N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) have been highly implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of depression. While NMDARs can be found inside and outside glutamate synapses, it remains unclear if NMDARs at synaptic (sNMDAR) and extrasynaptic locations (exNMDAR) play different roles in the formation of depression-related behaviors. Using chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), an animal model for anxiety- and depression-related behaviors, we found that mice susceptible to CSDS exhibited low hippocampal exNMDAR function. Raising exNMDAR function by enhancing the release of glutamate from astrocytic cystine-glutamate antiporters or targeting extrasynaptic receptors with agonist-coated gold nanoparticles that cannot enter the synaptic cleft prevented social avoidance behavior in stressed mice. Interestingly, ketamine, which is a fast-acting antidepressant, exhibited stronger blockade to sNMDARs than to exNMDARs. These findings suggest that the susceptibility and resilience of mice toward CSDS is related to low and high exNMDAR function in the hippocampus, respectively. Enhancing exNMDAR function could be a novel treatment approach for mood and anxiety disorders.

                        Diabetes-associated cognitive impairment (DACI) is a common complication of diabetes, and studies have shown that DACI is more severe in postmenopausal patients with diabetes.

However, it has not been confirmed whether FTSâ‹…B has a reversing or retarding effect on postmenopausal diabetic encephalopathy.

                        <AccordionContent>
                            Variations in early life maternal care modulate hippocampal development to program distinct emotional-cognitive phenotypes that persist into adulthood. Adult rat offspring that received low compared with high levels of maternal licking and grooming (low LG offspring) in early postnatal life show reduced long term potentiation (LTP) and impaired hippocampal-dependent memory, suggesting a 'detrimental' maternal effect on neural development. However, these studies focused uniquely on the dorsal hippocampus. Emerging evidence suggests a distinct role of the ventral hippocampus in mediating aggression, anxiety, and fear-memory formation, which are enhanced in low LG offspring. We report that variations in maternal care in the rat associate with opposing effects on hippocampal function in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Reduced pup licking associated with suppressed LTP formation in the dorsal hippocampus, but enhanced ventral hippocampal LTP. Ventral hippocampal neurons in low LG offspring fired action potentials at lower threshold voltages that were of larger amplitude and faster rise rate in comparison with those in high LG offspring. Furthermore, recordings of excitatory postsynaptic potential-to-spike coupling (E-S coupling) revealed an increase in excitability of ventral hippocampal CA1 neurons in low LG offspring. These effects do not associate with changes in miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents or paired-pulse facilitation, suggesting a specific effect of maternal care on intrinsic excitability. These findings suggest region-specific influences of maternal care in shaping neural development and synaptic plasticity.
